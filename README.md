# Machine Learning for Subscription Prediction

AIM:
The main aim of the project is to predict the Probability of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.


ABSTRACT:
The data is related with marketing campaigns of a Portugese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, 
more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no')
subscribed. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to term deposit.
